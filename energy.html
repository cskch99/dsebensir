              <h2>E3-Energy</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>The ability of human beings to use various forms of energy is one of the greatest
              developments in human history. Electrical energy brings cities to life. Modern
              transportation powered by energy links peoples together. Modern society is geared to using
              electricity as a main energy source. There are many reasons why electricity is the most
              common energy source used at home and in the office. This elective topic begins by
              reviewing domestic appliances for lighting, cooking and air-conditioning. These appliances
              show how physics principles are used to make our homes better and more comfortable places
              to live in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students investigate the total amount of energy transferred when these appliances
              are in operation. They also learn how to calculate the cost from power rating of the
              appliances. The idea of energy changes being associated with energy transfer is raised, and
              students identify the energy changes associated with a range of appliances. This leads into
              the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme informing the public to choose
              energy-efficient household appliances for saving energy. Building and transportation
              provide situations for students to study the factors affecting energy performance in real
              contexts. Building materials provide the starting point for discussion of the thermal
              properties of different materials to transfer energy; and this leads to consideration of a
              building design to minimise energy use and provide an appropriate internal environment
              without sacrificing its quality. Through the use of electric motors as energy converters in
              vehicles, students study the efficiency of electric motors compared to internal combustion
              engines, in the attempt to reduce air pollution.

            </p>
            <p>
              There are many energy sources used as fuel that can be converted into electricity. The
              current fuels used for generating electricity in Hong Kong include coal, petroleum, natural
              gas, nuclear fuel and pump storage. Students compare the efficiency of different fuels and
              different ways of using the same fuel. Through a consideration of the design features of a
              solar cooker, students investigate conduction, convection and radiation as means of
              transferring energy from nature. Different sources of energy have different environmental
              effects on society. When fossil fuels burn, a large amount of pollutants are discharged into
              the air.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pollutants cause atmospheric pollution, reduce air quality and contribute to the
              greenhouse effect which may warm and damage the Earth. Whereas nuclear power stations
              are very efficient, the disposal of dangerous radioactive waste materials continues to be a
              problem. The growing concern about the environmental impact of energy polluting the
              environment has made environmentally friendly and alternative energy sources worth
              considering. In this connection, emphasis is placed on the energy conservation principle, to
              encourage efficient energy usage in order to maintain and improve the quality of the environment. Energy
              efficiency can be described simply using an input-output model. For
              example, a solar cell can be understood generally as a transducer that has the solar radiation
              as input and a useful form of electrical energy as the output. Despite the fact that Hong
              Kong has no indigenous energy sources, solar cells and wind power are introduced as local
              contextual examples to illustrate the concept of renewable energy sources. This elective
              topic increases studentsâ€™ understanding of the application of physics, the uses of different
              energy sources and the implications of energy efficiency to the environment.
